<div class="middle"><h1>OUR SOLAR SYSTEM</h1></div>
<div class="hello">A solar system is a star and all of the objects that travel around itâ€”planets, moons, asteroids, comets and meteoroids. Most stars host their own planets, so there are likely tens of billions of other solar systems in the Milky Way galaxy alone. Solar systems can also have more than one star. These are called binary star systems if there are two stars, or multi-star systems if there are three or more stars.</div>
<p class="about">Did You Know?
</p>
<p class="it">Five spacecraft have achieved enough velocity to travel beyond the boundaries of our solar system. Voyager 1 crossed into interstellar space in 2012. Voyager 2 and New Horizons are still active and will eventually transition to the space between the stars. Pioneers 10 and 11 also have reached escape velocity, but both spacecraft have been inactive for many years
